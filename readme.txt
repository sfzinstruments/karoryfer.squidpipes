Squidpipes is a sample library for Plogue Sforzando version 1.933 or newer. It contains samples of bagpipes using a large squid's mantle as the bag.

To register the Sforzando bank, drag the Squidpipes.bank.xml file onto the Sforzando interface. Once registered, the instrument will be available in the Sforzando loading menu and the GUI will work.

There are three instruments - the Squidpipes play one monophonic melody note plus a keyswitchable drone note, the Squidotron is a polyphonic mellotron-like instrument, and the Squynth uses the samples in a subtractive synthesizer architecture.
